# Base

The base plates with holes for magnets (5x5x2mm) that fits on QG 5-8 sheet metal.

# BlindsFeeder

The BlindsFeeder with some local adjustments.

# Trays

For tray feeder. Fits on a Base plate and the pick location should be the same (including height) for the different parts, so the same "tray size" can swapped without ajusting the TrayFeeder settings.
